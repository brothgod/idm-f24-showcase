          What is IDM? The
          <a href="http://idm.engineering.nyu.edu/"
            >Integrated Design & Media Program (IDM)</a
          >
          is a place that fosters creative practice, design research and
          multidisciplinary experimentation with emerging media technologies.
          IDM is a ‘STEAM‘ program combining artistic inquiry with scientific
          research and technological practice to explore the social, cultural
          and ethical potentials of emerging technologies. We focus on how to
          create new experiences with technologies but also on what is
          worthmaking and why. In our academic programs, digital media is
          explored as a spectrum of practices that range from computer
          programming (for app development,software engineering, game
          development and interaction design) to 2D and 3D graphics (for
          human-computer interfaces, augmented reality, motion capture, and game
          design & development)to photography, film, and audio (for
          mediainstallations, performing arts research, and integration with
          various mediums). Our students are artists, designers, and creative
          technologists working in highly fluid industries that reward the
          creative, the thoughtful, the technical, and the innovative.
