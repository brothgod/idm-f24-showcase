    "description": "This project reimagines the electric guitar as a tool for spatial and sonic exploration. By utilizing both a hexaphonic and MIDI pickup, I can isolate and manipulate each string as an independent voice, creating intricate textures of sound. The work is presented in the Audio Lab at 370 Jay Street and employs a 50-speaker Dolby Atmos system to create an immersive environment where sound dynamically moves through space.\n\nYou will experience a live sound installation and concert that blurs the boundaries between performance and environment. Each note,  signal, and sonic element is precisely placed, enveloping the listener in a constantly shifting aural landscape.\n\nThis work challenges conventional notions of music and sound art by combining experimental guitar techniques with advanced spatial audio technologies. It explores amplification as a means of increasing volume and as a medium for reimagining space, storytelling, and human connection in a hyper-technological context.",

But it\u2019s the actions we take in response to that initial spark that transform it into a real, shareable creation. The project thus symbolizes the artist's journey, highlighting the connection between touch (representing effort or engagement) and the visible movement of the flower (representing progress or realization of intentions).\n\nThe mirror setup surrounding the glass dome amplifies this metaphor, allowing the viewer to see multiple angles of the flower and reflect upon the various dimensions of their own creative aspirations. It invites introspection: as users reach out to touch the sensor, they initiate a tangible transformation that mirrors the way intentionality and creativity evolve.",

    "description": "We often find ourselves drawn to a character, as if captivated by a mirror that responds. Perhaps Freud and Lacan's psychoanalytic theories can explain this action somehow\u2014that a character isn\u2019t just a character, but a reflection of an \u201cideal self\u201d we can never approach. In this reflection, in the mirror image of the character, we find the echoes of countless unseen thoughts intertwining and watching one another. Within the character\u2019s appearance, we see fragments of divided selves\u2014pieces of pasts, or parts of futures we have yet reached.\n\nI imagine a space, a dialogue: an interaction between audience and a figure inside of the mirror that is more than observation\u2014it\u2019s an experiment in discovery. Lacan believed that the human\u2019s self-recognition begins in infancy, shaped by the reflections in mirrors we see. Through this imagined character, we return to that beginning, peeking into the strong connection between \u201cI\u201d and \u201cOther.\u201d This character waits beyond the mirror. Its form is shifting and elusive because it is always our inner reflection\u2014a recombination of our self and our fantasies.\n\nIn the process of constructing and interacting with this fictional figure, I continuously reconsider and reshape ourselves. Through its existence, we see the essence of idealized forms of the self we pursue, and in this lies a different kind of truth. Our emotions flow between the mirrors and ourselves, and those attachments and fascinations we believe to be preferences\u2014could they, in fact, be a kind of illusion, a self-absorbed reverie\uff1f",

The racial wealth gap has been prevalent in the United States since the 19th century and has roots in the historical use of restrictive policies, household income, education, financial investment and inheritance. As a result, today\u2019s black middle-class are predominantly first-generation investors making financial decisions without many social or familial ties with experience in economic activities. Financial literacy is essential as knowledge on the subject is key to making informed decisions that result in accumulated wealth. However, developing financial literacy is at times hindered by its omission from school curriculums, the overwhelming manner in which it is taught, and for some minorities, the absence of successful models. My aim is to offer a thorough and interactive method to learning financial literacy and practicing it in your own life. I employ the strategies of gamification in education and offer users modules that will help initiate action in their financial journey.",

    "description": "My senior project focuses on sustainable housing solutions that help alleviate the housing crisis affecting many urban areas. Having grown up in NYC, I understand how high rents and paycheck-to-paycheck living make homeownership nearly impossible for average families. For this project, I\u2019ll explore the concept of floating houses as a viable option for NYC, demonstrating proposed locations and selecting materials to create housing that is both sustainable and affordable.",

The app provides personalized recommendations paired with brief contextual notes, allowing listeners to connect with each piece on an emotional level.\n\nAs I was growing up, I developed a lasting love for Western Classical Music through early piano lessons and later, the double bass. Over time, I noticed how difficult it can be for younger generations without a music background to connect with classical pieces, often feeling it\u2019s too formal or inaccessible. Poco is my answer to making Classical Music approachable and enjoyable in a way that doesn\u2019t feel forced or overwhelmed, offering listeners an easy gateway into the rich beauty of it.",
