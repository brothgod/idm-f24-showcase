    "description": "Project Introduction:\n\"Herstory\" is a 3D escape room game that integrates VR technology and local cooperative gameplay for two players. It discusses feminism and promotes traditional Chinese culture while challenging and redefining conventional historical narratives by recounting and commemorating historically marginalized female heroes. Traditional historical narratives often revolve around men, with countless extraordinary and great women fading into oblivion, often only appearing as appendages to men. These women, who broke through numerous feudal restrictions against them, are neither celebrated, their achievements are often credited to others, or even stigmatized... In many cultures, it is said that death is not the end; being forgotten is. Players are chosen to witness and bear the responsibility of passing down and celebrating their history and are guided to reflect on deeper feminist issues. \"Herstory\" aims to explore and present the stories that truly belong to these women, or \"Her story,\" through the medium of a game. In the game, players will have the opportunity to learn about N\u00fcshu, a mysterious and unique script used by women, discover ancient Chinese female figures rarely recorded in history, and express their respect and commemoration through the traditional ritual of offering incense to these women.\n\nBackground Story:\nIn many cultures, there exists a belief that death is not the final end; being forgotten is the true oblivion. Traditional historical narratives often revolve around men, relegating women to mere footnotes as attachments to men, leading to countless distinguished and great women fading from collective memory as history flows on. One day in 2024, a historian inadvertently steps into a decrepit temple, unknowingly crossing the edge of time. A mysterious spirit, wielding her profound knowledge of astrology, gathers the waning powers of other female spirits from various dynasties, who are gradually dissipating, summoning the historian into a special realm. This temple is a sanctuary preserved by their collective strength, untouched by the ravages of time. However, as these spirits become increasingly forgotten by the world, their power wanes, and this special realm faces the fate of fading away along with the spirits. To rescue these spirits and restore the temple to its former glory, the player is bestowed with an extraordinary mission: to traverse through time and space, deciphering the N\u00fcshu, the women's script, to unveil the hidden truths of history. By conducting the ritual of offering incense to venerate these spirits, the stories of these female historical heroines can be sung once more, regaining their glory and ensuring their legacy endures.",

The barrelman takes caution and scopes out a sea monster ahead, advising the helmsman to steer clear. The helmsman ignores his request and sails straight into danger, ready to be awarded the bounty money after slaying the beast. Meanwhile, the bilgerat is busy staring out at sea hoping to see a beautiful mermaid. Blackwater Buccaneers doesn't just make you play as a pirate. It turns you INTO one.",

    "description": "Penglai is a concept in Chinese mythology that shares common elements with different folklores in China and Japan. At the heart of this myth is the divine tree with its fruits as a symbol of the desire for immortality and growth. Eternity, growth and connection are concepts echoed across global cultures, such as Yggdrasil, the Tree of Life, and the Egyptian Acacia. These similarities suggest a common perspective across diverse cultures.  This work explores the possibility of a magical interconnection between our aboriginal cultures and asks a compelling question: Are the divine trees described in various cultures distinct beings, or do they originate from a single, ancient source? Incorporating a silver snake, a creature stepping in transformative symbolism, along with the combination of clay and lotus as a hint of the origin, riverstones as the land, and a disco ball representing the sun, casting fragmented yet harmonious light, the work creates a space where past and present, global and local, and the celestial and terrestrial converge. This convergence compels us to consider that maybe the commons between us are more than we think.",

This exhibition utilizes interactive screens and videos to educate audiences on the interconnectedness between diverse species and showcasing how this intricate web of interactions could manifest on another habitable world. It allows viewers to marvel at the mutualistic bonds between organisms, emphasizing their collective ability not only to flourish on Earth but also potentially in the vast expanses of outer space.\n\nUltimately, \"Illuminating Harmony\" invites viewers to wonder how we might draw lessons from these harmonious relationships among species and utilize them as tools for sustaining life\u2014both on our home planet and beyond.",

In a world yearning for profound connections and inspiring experiences, redefining how we engage with knowledge and creativity is not just a question but a necessity.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the natural wonders of our planet and guided by the principles of Earth's ecosystems, \u201cAetheria: Celestial Unveiling\u201d paints a vivid portrait of extraterrestrial life. Through a fusion of physical installation and digital technology, the piece aims to blur the boundaries between the familiar and the unknown, offering audiences a glimpse into the biodiversity that may exist beyond our solar system.\n\nThe installation invites active engagement, prompting participants to become co-creators of the experience. By taking participants through a journey of sights, sounds, and sensations of an alien ecosystem, it challenges them to reconsider their relationship with the natural world and contemplate the interconnectedness of all living things. In doing so, Aetheria offers a glimpse into a future where art, science, and technology converge to deepen our understanding of the universe and our place within it.",

    "description": "Monster is a film about personal struggles with mental blocks, the fear of failure, and being diagnosed with BPD. This film contains some horror elements, but is not intended to be scary. Instead, the hope is to use certain horror tropes to examine the feelings of our main character as she traverses an unwelcome environment. Animation, characters, story, and voice acting is by me. Joe Shoen created the audio experience.",

    "description": "Who are you? Who are we? What can we create when our minds come together? How can we blend together? This sonic experience aims to focus on a unique moment when two human minds come together to create a multisensory experience, which can only be created in this exact moment in life, showing us the importance of fleeting moments and our minds reaction to stimuli. An experience that is purely driven by two people\u2019s minds and the synchrony between one another.  \n\nSana\u2019s journey in creating Waves of Us was inspired by two moving experiences in her life: a sound bath in Bali, Indonesia and a sound sculptured theater in San Francisco, California that is experienced in pitch darkness. Both experiences had common characteristics in that they are based on impact to an individual by sound and vibrations. This paired with Sana\u2019s user experience background and constant desire to understand humans on a psychological level, pushed her to see what else she could explore when it came to human beings, which is where Biofeedback comes in. Biofeedback is the study of humans based on body functions in order to create the best personalized experience.\n\nIn order to utilize the right Biofeedback tool for the installation, Sana tested multiple biofeedback tools including a machine learning voice model she developed to pick up emotion via speech tone, a face API for emotion detection, pulse oximeter and EEG headset to understand what tools best picked up on human emotion. After extensive testing she landed on using the EEG headset by Muse as the best and accurate tool to use for this installation due to its ability to capture brainwaves. \n\nThe biofeedback space is still a new and emerging industry that has not been fully tapped into when creating digital and physical experiences. Sana would like to continue to contribute to this subject area by using meaningful data she is capturing in impactful and impressionable ways for users.",

For my senior project, my goal is to create the interface for a (21+) drinking game app that is primarily used in groups of people to break the ice and allow people to laugh, drink, and learn more about each other. The app would only require one person to have it downloaded, so it will not be an entirely individualistic digital/online experience, rather everyone will interact in person, guided by the content on one phone. The app is timeless and has a multitude of games ranging from card games, word play, roulette and more. Its built so groups of people don't have to face dreadful small talk, and can enjoy each-others company together without forcing conversations.",
